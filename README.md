# Speech-Emotion-Recognition

Speech emotion recognition is a challenging task in the field of machine learning. 
In this study, we propose a deep learning-based approach for speech emotion 
recognition using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Run the provided notebook in kaggle notebooks or you can use google collab but you will need to download the datasets from kaggle.
